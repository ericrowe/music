The bird cage was used in the 2023 season, and consisted of three main components:
1. A Steel and Wood base, on casters.
2. A Steel cage, attached to the base and assembled with pins.
3. A PVC and 3d printed top.

These designs only include the PVC and 3d printed top.

Use your judgement when printing these parts.  PLA is probably good enough, but anything that needs to be cemented to PVC would need to be printed from ABS.

The top was constructed with 0.75" PVC, painted gold.  The PVC legs were connected with 3d printed couplers at the corners, sides, and a large locking mechanism at the top.  The design only shows some of the components - any duplicate components were not modeled to save time.

The top piece consists of two clamshell halves that fit together.  The tops of the verticals (made of PVC) have caps installed on them that are retained by the clamshell.  The clamshell is then closed, and secured with the large screw.

To aid in assembly, a pole at the height of the bottom of the top piece was fabricated out of 4x4 wood with velcro on the top.  The top piece could then be stuck to that platform while the remaining components were assembled.

To assemble:
1. lay out the base pieces, insert the PVC into the corners, and pin in place with 1/4" pins.
2. Install the bottom half of the top clamshell onto the assembly jig (made from an old 4x4), and place in the center of the base.
3. Insert the verticals into the receivers on the base pieces, and lay into the bottom half of the top clamshell.
4. Install the top of the clamshell and secure with the large bolt.
5. Remove the assembly jig, and raise the completed assembly onto the bird cage.

Lessons Learned:
1. We did not cement the retaining pieces to the PVC.  In at least two cases, the retaining pieces pulled out and had to be hastily repaired on the field.
2. We did not pin the side pieces.  In at least two cases, some of those side pieces pulled out and had to be hastily repaired on the field.
