Trumpet cases frequently have a built in mouthpiece holder.  Just as frequently they don't.  Or if you use any of the heavyweight mouthpieces out there (megatone, gr tech, etc), they won't fit anyway.

This is a simple sleeve to hold the mouthpiece and protect it from drops, and protect your instrument from getting banged from it.  Printed from TPU with low infill, it has a nice pillow like squishiness to it.

The holes in the top and bottom are there for breathability and drainage.  I recommend cleaning out the cases (or replacing them) regularly as well to prevent mold growth.
