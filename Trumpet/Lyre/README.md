This is a simple lyre designed to install on a student model trumpet (or any trumpet with the semi-standard adjustable third valve slide ring).

The printed parts include the main stand and some side wings to help keep the music under control outside.

Not included are the post that goes down to the trumpet and a few binder rings to hold the music.  I experimented with printed posts, but in the end I decided to go with a low cost allen key, with a little bit of the points ground off - this proved to be much more stable than any of the plastic prototypes I printed.

The Grind Block is a simple tool to assist in grinding the points off the allen key - it simply holds the allen key at a fixed angle while you grind off the tips.
