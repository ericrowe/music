This accessible holder was developed for use by all the middle school trumpet players out there that break their arms.  Apparently this is a common problem.  Also apparently it is a frequent cause of trumpeteers quitting the instrument, as it gets harder with one hand and this discourages them just when they're starting to get skills.

It consists of a chest plate that you strap to your body, an arm that extends out at a roughly 45 degree angle, and a pad mounted to the top of the arm.  To use it, you simply rest the trumpet on the pad.  This aleviates some of the stress of playing one handed, and is particularly useful if you happen to break your left arm as it makes it easy to play with only your right arm and hand.

To build this you'll need a few more parts from Amazon. The costs add up here, but you can reuse all of them if you only need this temporarily while healing from an injury. Biggest cost is the selfie stick, which could be replaced with a short stick of a fixed length.  However that length does change from person to person, so test before you cut it to length.

1. Selfie Stick. You need one with a ¼" tripod thread on the bottom, and a go pro style mount on the top. I used this one: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ST1Y2QU) and it turns out the go pro style mount is just threaded onto a tripod thread at the top as well so you can just add that later if you already have a selfie stick.
2. Camera Ball Mount. The smaller the better. [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09NJJ2DKM)
3. Saxophone neck strap. [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076H6BT6N)
4. ¼-20 ½" Hex Bolt. I bought the SS ones from Lowes. Used to attach the ball mount to the chest plate.
5. M5 20mm Bolt (for the go pro mount)
6. M5 12mm Bolt (for the sax strap clip)
7. M5 Nut (for the sax strap clip). I used a nyloc one I had laying around, but that's overkill.
8. 1" webbing and clips: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LD8CJ8D)
